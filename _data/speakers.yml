  bio: "Maximiliano first discovered his love for typography while studying graphic design at Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. As an innocent font hobby turned to addiction, his type design career matured at an incredibly rapid rate, due much to his fascination with calligraphy. After graduating from college, he started a serie of trips to the US to study with the best calligraphers of the world. <br> In 2008 he founded his own foundry, Lián Types, mixing his interest in calligraphy with a growing skillfulness in digitizing the most challenging of curves. The foundry is now among the most successful ones specializing in script fonts and ornamented display type. He is also a teacher of gestural calligraphy, an excellent excuse, like he says, to take a rest from the digital media, gain inspiration and let the ink flow.<br> Many of his creations were awarded in the most prestigious typography competitions (such as SOTA Catalyst Awards, Type Directors Club, Communication Arts, Italian A’Design and Tipos Latinos), appeared in numerous respected Best of Year lists and were also published in several magazines and books of design."
